        // Ideas
        // -- Events such as branching paths and enemy camps.
        // -- Possibility of clearing levels of the mine
        // -- Drops from getting into certain levels of the mine
        // -- Armors made from crafting enemy parts or potion crafting <- this would need a whole entire inventory system just for holding enemy parts. That being said I could have a set of possible items and you wouldnt be able to open it or something like that. 

        // TODO
        // -- Combat
        // -- Dungeon
        // -- Polish up everything
        // -- Figure out what automatic unit testing is
        // -- Unit testing kinda <- this will test some functions for crashing but thats about it as its not possible really to have any other tests for a game like this.
        // -- Add more features if I really wanna
        // -- Submit final version
